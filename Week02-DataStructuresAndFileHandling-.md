# Overview

Here is an overview of what students cover this week:

* 2.1 [Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets](https://github.com/Lee-Rice/python-essentials/blob/main/lessons/02DataStructuresAndFileHandling.md#21-lists-tuples-dictionaries-and-sets)
  * Mutable vs. Immutable lists
    * Mutable data structure
      * Data it contains can be modified after creation.

    * Immutable data structure
      * Data cannot be changed after creation.

  * Lists
    * Mutable, ordered collection of items.
    * Can contain duplicate values.
    * Can store data of different data types.
  
  * Tuples
    * Immutable, ordered collection of items.

  * Dictionaries
    * Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
    * Keys are unique.
  * Sets
    * Unordered collection of unique elements.
* 2.2 [File Handling](https://github.com/Lee-Rice/python-essentials/blob/main/lessons/02DataStructuresAndFileHandling.md#22-file-handling)

# Assignment Rubric

You can mark the student's assignment as complete if their submission:

* [ ] Uses proper syntax and good Python logic to answer the questions.
* [ ] Completes each task as defined by the assignment.
* [ ] Runs properly without errors (unless generating an error is part of the task).
* [ ] <Another requirement>

## Example solutions

Note: Solutions will vary based on student style and input values used.
